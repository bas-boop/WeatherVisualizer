# WeatherVisualizer
A weather visualizer with some game elements. Probably going to make it for Android.

## API KEY
To make it work for yourself after clone this repo, change the `api key`. I use [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for the weather data, get your key here and use that. Put that in a file called `Config.json` and put that in the folder `Assets/StreamingAssets`, here below is how it should look like.

[Example config.json](Assets/StreamingAssets/ExampleConfig.json)
````json
{
  "OpenWeatherMapApiKey": "Your_API_key"
}
